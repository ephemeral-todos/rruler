## Overview

Rruler is a standalone RFC 5545 Recurrence Rule (RRULE) Parser and Occurrence Dates Calculator that helps developers building TODO applications and calendar systems by providing comprehensive support for complex recurring patterns with strict validation and error handling.

Rruler serves PHP developers building calendar and scheduling applications who need reliable RRULE parsing without the complexity of full WebDAV/CalDAV ecosystems. Unlike heavy libraries like sabre/dav, Rruler provides a focused, modern PHP 8.3+ solution with AST-based parsing for better maintainability and extensibility while ensuring strict RFC 5545 compliance.
