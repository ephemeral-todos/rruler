## 2025-07-26: Initial Product Planning

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead, Team

### Decision

Create a standalone RFC 5545 Recurrence Rule (RRULE) Parser and Occurrence Dates Calculator focused specifically on RRULE parsing and occurrence generation, targeting PHP developers building TODO and calendar applications.

### Context

Existing PHP solutions like sabre/dav are heavy and based on an aging codebase. Developers need a modern, focused solution that handles only RRULE parsing without the complexity of full WebDAV/CalDAV ecosystems. The market lacks a dedicated, actively maintained PHP library for RFC 5545 RRULE compliance.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Contribute to sabre/dav**
   - Pros: Established user base, existing functionality
   - Cons: Legacy codebase, over-engineered, nearly abandoned

2. **Fork existing libraries (recurr, php-rrule)**
   - Pros: Existing code to build upon
   - Cons: Inherit technical debt, limited scope/features

3. **Build from scratch (Selected)**
   - Pros: Modern PHP practices, focused scope, clean architecture
   - Cons: More initial development effort

### Rationale

Building from scratch allows us to leverage modern PHP 8.3+ features, implement clean AST-based parsing, and maintain a focused scope that serves developers' actual needs without unnecessary complexity.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Modern, maintainable codebase using PHP 8.3+ features
- Focused library scope reduces complexity and improves performance
- AST-based parser provides better extensibility and accuracy
- Comprehensive testing against established solutions (sabre/dav)

**Negative:**
- Longer initial development timeline compared to forking existing solutions
- Need to build comprehensive test coverage from scratch
- Responsibility for full RFC 5545 compliance implementation

## 2025-07-26: AST-Based Parser Architecture

**ID:** DEC-002
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, Development Team

### Decision

Implement an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) based parser for RRULE parsing, with regex-based parsing as a fallback option if AST proves too complex during implementation.

### Context

RRULE parsing can be implemented using various approaches including regex-based parsing, state machines, or AST-based parsing. The choice affects maintainability, extensibility, and parsing accuracy.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Regex-based parsing**
   - Pros: Simple to implement, fast execution
   - Cons: Difficult to maintain, limited extensibility, error-prone for complex patterns

2. **AST-based parsing (Selected)**
   - Pros: Better extensibility, more accurate parsing, easier to debug
   - Cons: More complex initial implementation

### Rationale

AST-based parsing provides better long-term maintainability and extensibility, which aligns with our goal of creating a robust, professional library. The fallback to regex ensures we can deliver even if AST proves overly complex.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- More maintainable and extensible parser architecture
- Better error reporting and debugging capabilities
- Professional-grade implementation approach

**Negative:**
- Increased initial development complexity
- Potential for over-engineering if not carefully managed

## 2025-07-26: Minimal Production Dependencies

**ID:** DEC-003
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, Development Team

### Decision

Keep production dependencies to an absolute minimum, using only built-in PHP classes (DateTime/DateTimeImmutable) and custom validation logic. Development dependencies may include testing and quality tools.

### Context

Library adoption is often hindered by complex dependency trees. A focused RRULE library should minimize external dependencies to ensure easy integration and reduce potential conflicts.

### Rationale

Minimal dependencies improve library adoption, reduce security surface area, and ensure long-term maintainability without external library obsolescence risks.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Easier adoption and integration into existing projects
- Reduced security and maintenance overhead
- No dependency conflicts with consuming applications

**Negative:**
- More custom implementation required
- Cannot leverage existing validation or utility libraries

## 2025-08-02: Behavioral Testing Strategy

**ID:** DEC-004
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, Development Team

### Decision

Focus on behavioral testing that validates what the code does rather than structural/reflection-based tests that verify class architecture or method existence.

### Context

Testing approaches can focus on behavior (functional outcomes) or structure (class design, method existence). Structural tests provide no functional validation and create maintenance overhead.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Structural/Reflection-based testing**
   - Pros: Ensures architectural compliance
   - Cons: No behavioral validation, maintenance overhead, breaks during refactoring

2. **Behavioral testing (Selected)**
   - Pros: Validates actual functionality, meaningful test failures, refactoring-safe
   - Cons: Requires more thoughtful test design

### Rationale

Behavioral tests provide real value by ensuring the library works correctly for users, while structural tests only verify implementation details that may change during legitimate refactoring.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Tests validate actual user-facing functionality
- Refactoring doesn't break meaningful tests
- Test failures indicate real problems
- Focus on "what" rather than "how"

**Negative:**
- Requires more careful test design
- May miss some architectural issues
- Less obvious which components to test

## 2025-08-02: Interface Testing in Concrete Classes

**ID:** DEC-005
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, Development Team

### Decision

Test interface functionality within concrete class tests rather than creating separate interface test files.

### Context

Interfaces define contracts but have no meaningful functionality without concrete implementations. Testing interface behavior separately from implementations creates duplication and provides no additional value.

### Rationale

Interface functionality is only meaningful in the context of concrete implementations. Testing in concrete classes provides real-world usage scenarios and reduces test maintenance overhead.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Interface behavior tested in realistic usage contexts
- Reduced test duplication and maintenance
- Focus on actual behavior rather than abstract contracts

**Negative:**
- Interface contracts not explicitly validated in isolation
- Potential for missing edge cases in interface definitions
