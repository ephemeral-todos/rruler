> Spec: Python-dateutil Fixture Testing System
> Created: 2025-08-12

## Overview

Implement a hybrid python-dateutil fixture generation system that adds authoritative RRULE correctness validation alongside existing sabre/vobject compatibility tests, using YAML fixtures for focused testing without disrupting current infrastructure.

## User Stories

### Enhanced RFC 5545 Validation

As a library maintainer, I want to validate RRULE parsing and occurrence generation against python-dateutil's authoritative implementation, so that I can ensure RFC 5545 compliance beyond just sabre/vobject compatibility.

The system will run python-dateutil alongside existing tests, providing dual validation that catches edge cases and ensures both compatibility and correctness. This addresses scenarios where sabre/vobject may have implementation quirks that differ from the RFC 5545 specification.

### YAML-Based Edge Case Testing

As a developer, I want to define critical test scenarios in YAML fixtures, so that I can easily maintain and expand edge case coverage without writing verbose PHP test code.

The YAML fixture system will complement existing compatibility tests by providing a clean way to define complex RRULE scenarios, expected occurrences, and validation criteria in a human-readable format.

## Spec Scope

1. **Hybrid Validation System** - Preserve all existing compatibility test files and methods while adding python-dateutil fixture-based validation layer
2. **YAML Fixture Framework** - Create YAML-based test definition system for critical and edge case RRULE scenarios  
3. **Python Integration** - Use python-dateutil and PyYAML for fixture generation providing authoritative RFC 5545 validation
4. **Compatibility Infrastructure** - Extend existing CompatibilityTestCase and reporting systems to support fixture-based dual validation
5. **Focused Test Coverage** - Target critical RRULE patterns and edge cases that benefit most from authoritative validation

## Out of Scope

- Replacing existing sabre/vobject compatibility tests completely
- Converting all test scenarios to YAML format
- Adding python-dateutil validation to every single test case
- Modifying core RRULE parsing or occurrence generation logic

## Expected Deliverable

1. Existing compatibility tests continue to pass with sabre/vobject validation intact
2. Selected test scenarios additionally validate against pre-generated python-dateutil fixture results
3. YAML fixture system allows easy definition of new critical test scenarios
4. Comprehensive test coverage report showing dual validation results
5. Documentation for maintaining and extending the hybrid fixture-based testing system

## Implementation Notes

- **Fixtures Location**: The fixtures directory is located at `tests/fixtures/python-dateutil/` to keep test data organized within the test structure
- **Directory Structure**: 
  - `tests/fixtures/python-dateutil/input/` - YAML input specifications for fixture generation
  - `tests/fixtures/python-dateutil/generated/` - Generated YAML fixtures with python-dateutil results
