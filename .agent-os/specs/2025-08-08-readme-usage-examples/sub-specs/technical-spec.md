# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-08-08-readme-usage-examples/spec.md

> Created: 2025-08-08
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

### README Structure Requirements
- **File Location:** Root directory README.md (replacing existing if present)
- **Format:** Markdown with proper heading hierarchy (H1 for title, H2 for sections)
- **Code Examples:** PHP code blocks with syntax highlighting using ```php
- **Length Target:** 150-250 lines to maintain scannability while providing substance

### Content Organization
- **Opening Section:** Library name, tagline, and value proposition within first 50 lines
- **Installation Section:** Composer command with PHP version requirement
- **Usage Examples:** 3-4 practical scenarios with complete, runnable code blocks
- **Positioning Section:** Clear comparison with sabre/dav highlighting focused scope

### Code Example Requirements
- **Completeness:** Each example should be copy-pasteable and functional
- **Real-world Context:** Examples should solve actual calendar/TODO application needs
- **Error Handling:** Include basic try/catch blocks to demonstrate proper usage
- **Output Display:** Show expected results (occurrence dates) for each example

### API Demonstration Approach
- **Core Workflow:** Parse RRULE string → Generate occurrences → Display results
- **Class Usage:** Demonstrate Rruler main class and basic methods
- **Date Handling:** Show proper DateTime/DateTimeImmutable integration
- **Range Filtering:** Include examples with start/end date boundaries

### Positioning Strategy
- **Target Audience:** Developers building calendar/scheduling applications needing focused RRULE parsing
- **Differentiation:** Emphasize lightweight, modern PHP implementation vs heavy WebDAV ecosystems
- **When to Use:** Clear guidance on scenarios where Rruler is preferred over sabre/dav
- **Migration Path:** Brief mention of compatibility testing against sabre/dav for confidence
