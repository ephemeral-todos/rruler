> Spec: BYSETPOS Support Implementation  
> Created: 2025-08-06
> Status: **COMPLETED** âœ…
> Completed: 2025-08-06

## Overview

Implement RFC 5545 BYSETPOS parameter support for advanced occurrence selection from expanded recurrence sets. This feature enables selecting specific occurrences (like "last Sunday of March" or "first and last weekday of month") from complex RRULE patterns.

## User Stories

### Advanced Scheduling Patterns

As a calendar application developer, I want to create complex recurring patterns like "last Sunday of March" or "first and last business day of each month", so that I can support sophisticated scheduling requirements that match real-world business needs.

**Workflow**: Parse RRULE strings containing BYSETPOS parameters, expand the base recurrence pattern using existing BY* rules, then select specific occurrences from that expanded set based on BYSETPOS values (positive for beginning, negative for end).

### Holiday and Business Day Patterns

As a business application developer, I want to schedule events on patterns like "first Monday of each quarter" or "last working day of each month", so that I can automate business processes that follow complex but predictable scheduling patterns.

**Workflow**: Combine BYSETPOS with existing BYMONTH, BYDAY, and other BY* rules to create sophisticated patterns that would be difficult to express with simple recurrence rules.

## Spec Scope

1. **BYSETPOS Parser Integration** - Extend RRULE parser to recognize and validate BYSETPOS parameters
2. **Advanced Occurrence Selection** - Implement logic to select specific positions from expanded occurrence sets  
3. **RFC 5545 Compliance** - Full compliance with BYSETPOS specification including positive/negative indexing
4. **Integration with Existing BY* Rules** - Seamless combination with BYDAY, BYMONTHDAY, BYMONTH, BYWEEKNO
5. **Comprehensive Validation** - Error handling for invalid BYSETPOS values and combinations

## Out of Scope

- BYSETPOS without other BY* rules (invalid per RFC 5545)
- Performance optimization beyond basic efficiency
- Complex interaction with EXDATE/EXRULE (future feature)

## Expected Deliverable

1. Parse RRULE strings with BYSETPOS and generate correct occurrence patterns for complex scheduling scenarios
2. Validate BYSETPOS combinations and provide clear error messages for invalid usage
3. Integration test coverage demonstrating real-world scheduling patterns work correctly
