# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: BYMONTH Implementation
> Created: 2025-08-02

## Overview

Implement BYMONTH parameter support for yearly recurrence patterns, allowing users to specify which months should have occurrences in yearly recurring events. This feature enables patterns like quarterly occurrences (FREQ=YEARLY;BYMONTH=3,6,9,12) and other month-specific yearly recurrences.

## User Stories

### Monthly Selection for Yearly Events

As a developer building calendar applications, I want to specify which months should have occurrences in yearly patterns, so that I can create events like quarterly meetings, seasonal activities, or anniversary reminders that only occur in specific months.

**Workflow:** Parse RRULE strings containing BYMONTH parameters, validate month values (1-12), and generate occurrences only for the specified months within yearly recurrence patterns.

## Spec Scope

1. **BYMONTH Parser Node** - Create ByMonthNode AST class for parsing BYMONTH parameters
2. **Month Validation** - Validate month values are integers between 1-12 inclusive
3. **Yearly Pattern Integration** - Integrate BYMONTH filtering with existing yearly frequency logic
4. **Multiple Month Support** - Support comma-separated month lists (e.g., BYMONTH=1,4,7,10)
5. **Occurrence Generation** - Generate occurrences only for specified months in yearly patterns

## Out of Scope

- BYMONTH support for non-yearly frequencies (DAILY, WEEKLY, MONTHLY)
- BYMONTH interaction with BYSETPOS (future enhancement)
- BYMONTH with BYWEEKNO combinations (future enhancement)

## Expected Deliverable

1. Parse RRULE strings with BYMONTH parameters and generate correct yearly occurrences
2. Validate month values and provide clear error messages for invalid input
3. Support multiple month specifications in comma-separated format
