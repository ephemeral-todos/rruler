# Spec Summary (Lite)

Implement BYMONTH parameter support for yearly recurrence patterns, allowing users to specify which months should have occurrences in yearly recurring events. This enables patterns like quarterly occurrences (FREQ=YEARLY;BYMONTH=3,6,9,12) and other month-specific yearly recurrences with proper validation and occurrence generation.
