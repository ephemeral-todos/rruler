# Test Cleanup and Refactoring - Lite Summary

Clean up test suite by removing low-value infrastructure tests, moving utilities to appropriate locations, and improving test focus on business logic. This project enhances test maintainability by organizing testing infrastructure properly and ensuring tests validate business behavior rather than testing framework mechanics, resulting in clearer test failures and better developer experience.
