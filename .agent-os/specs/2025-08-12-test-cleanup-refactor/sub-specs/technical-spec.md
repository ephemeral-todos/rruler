# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-08-12-test-cleanup-refactor/spec.md

> Created: 2025-08-12
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

### Infrastructure Test Identification and Removal
- Analyze test suite to identify tests that validate testing framework mechanics rather than business logic
- Remove tests that use PHP reflection to verify class structure or method existence  
- Eliminate tests that validate interface implementation without behavioral verification
- Preserve behavioral tests that validate actual RRULE parsing and occurrence generation functionality

### Testing Utility Organization
- Create src/Testing directory structure following project conventions
- Move testing utilities from tests/ directory to src/Testing/ with appropriate subdirectories
- Implement autoloading configuration for src/Testing utilities
- Update existing tests to reference utilities in new locations
- Maintain backward compatibility during transition

### Benchmark Script Migration
- Identify performance measurement scripts currently in tests/ directory
- Create scripts/benchmarks/ directory structure
- Move benchmark scripts to scripts/ with proper executable permissions
- Update documentation references to new benchmark script locations
- Ensure benchmark scripts maintain current functionality

### Documentation Integration Testing
- Extract code examples from README.md and other documentation
- Create integration tests that validate documentation examples work correctly
- Implement test workflow that ensures README examples stay current with API changes
- Structure tests to validate end-to-end user workflows shown in documentation

### Test Consolidation and Assertion Improvement
- Identify overly specific edge case tests that can be combined into broader behavioral tests
- Replace string-content assertions with behavioral assertions that verify functionality
- Consolidate duplicate test scenarios while maintaining comprehensive coverage
- Ensure consolidated tests maintain clear failure messages and debugging information

## Approach

### Phase-Based Implementation
- **Phase 1:** Infrastructure test removal and analysis
- **Phase 2:** Testing utility organization and migration  
- **Phase 3:** Benchmark script relocation
- **Phase 4:** Documentation integration testing
- **Phase 5:** Test consolidation and assertion improvement

### Validation Strategy
- Run full test suite after each phase to ensure no regressions
- Maintain test coverage percentage throughout cleanup process
- Validate that business logic tests continue to provide meaningful failure information
- Ensure sabre/dav compatibility testing remains intact

### File Organization Standards
- Follow existing project directory structure conventions
- Use PSR-4 autoloading standards for src/Testing utilities
- Maintain clear separation between test code and utility code
- Preserve existing naming conventions and coding standards

## External Dependencies

No new external dependencies required. This refactoring uses existing project infrastructure and follows established patterns.
