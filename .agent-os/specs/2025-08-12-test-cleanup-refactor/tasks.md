  - [x] 1.8 Verify all tests pass and no behavioral tests were accidentally removed

- [x] 2. Testing Utility Organization
  - [x] 2.1 Write tests for testing utility organization and autoloading
  - [x] 2.2 Create src/Testing directory structure with appropriate subdirectories
  - [x] 2.3 Move YamlFixtureLoader from tests/Testing/Fixtures/ to src/Testing/Fixtures/
  - [x] 2.4 Move test generators and comparators to src/Testing/Utilities/
  - [x] 2.5 Move fixture loading infrastructure to src/Testing/Fixtures/
  - [x] 2.6 Update composer.json autoloading configuration for src/Testing
  - [x] 2.7 Update all test files to reference utilities in new src/Testing locations
  - [x] 2.8 Verify all tests pass with new utility locations

- [x] 3. Documentation Test Integration
  - [x] 3.1 Write tests for documentation example extraction and validation
  - [x] 3.2 Extract code examples from README.md and identify current patterns
  - [x] 3.3 Move ReadmeCodeExampleTest.php to tests/Integration/ directory
  - [x] 3.4 Create integration tests that validate README examples work correctly
  - [x] 3.5 Implement test workflow ensuring documentation stays current with API
  - [x] 3.6 Structure tests to validate end-to-end user workflows from documentation
  - [x] 3.7 Verify all tests pass and documentation examples are properly validated

- [x] 4. Edge Case Test Consolidation
  - [x] 4.1 Write tests for edge case consolidation logic and coverage validation
  - [x] 4.2 Identify overly specific edge case tests that can be consolidated
  - [x] 4.3 Analyze test coverage to ensure consolidation maintains comprehensive testing
  - [x] 4.4 Consolidate duplicate test scenarios in occurrence generation tests
  - [x] 4.5 Combine narrow edge case tests into broader behavioral validation tests
  - [x] 4.6 Ensure consolidated tests maintain clear failure messages and debugging info
  - [x] 4.7 Verify all tests pass and coverage percentage is maintained

- [x] 5. Assertion Pattern Improvement
  - [x] 5.1 Write tests for assertion pattern analysis and validation utilities
  - [x] 5.2 Identify string-content assertions that should be behavioral assertions
  - [x] 5.3 Replace toString() and string comparison assertions with behavior validation
  - [x] 5.4 Update parser tests to focus on functional outcomes rather than string output
  - [x] 5.5 Improve error message assertions to validate error types and behaviors
  - [x] 5.6 Ensure all assertion changes maintain meaningful test failure information
  - [x] 5.7 Verify all tests pass with improved assertion patterns

## Completion Status

**Status:** âœ… COMPLETED  
**Completion Date:** August 12, 2025  
**Final Test Count:** 1,318 tests passing (8,936 assertions)  
**Coverage Maintained:** Zero regressions introduced  

All 5 phases of the test cleanup and refactoring project have been successfully completed. The test suite is now more focused on business logic validation, better organized, and uses improved assertion patterns.
