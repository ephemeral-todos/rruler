> Spec: Test Cleanup and Refactoring

## Overview

Clean up test suite by removing low-value infrastructure tests, moving utilities to appropriate locations, and improving test focus on business logic. This project will enhance test maintainability and developer experience by organizing testing infrastructure properly and ensuring tests validate business behavior rather than testing framework mechanics.

## User Stories

### Developer Experience Enhancement

As a developer, I want tests focused on business logic rather than infrastructure so that test failures indicate real problems with functionality and guide me toward actual issues that need fixing.

**Workflow:** Developer runs test suite and receives clear, actionable feedback about business logic issues without noise from infrastructure validation that provides no functional value.

### Testing Infrastructure Organization

As a maintainer, I want testing utilities properly organized in src/Testing so they're reusable, properly structured, and follow established project conventions for utility organization.

**Workflow:** Maintainer can easily locate, modify, and extend testing utilities in a predictable location that matches the project's architectural patterns for supporting infrastructure.

### Clear Test vs Utility Separation

As a contributor, I want clear separation between actual tests and benchmark/utility scripts so I understand what needs to be maintained as tests versus what serves as development tooling.

**Workflow:** Contributor can distinguish between behavioral validation tests that must be maintained and utility scripts that support development but aren't part of the core test suite validation.

## Spec Scope

1. **Infrastructure Test Removal** - Remove tests that validate testing framework rather than business logic
2. **Benchmark Script Migration** - Move performance benchmarks from tests/ to scripts/ directory  
3. **Testing Utility Organization** - Move testing infrastructure and utilities to src/Testing with proper subdirectories
4. **Documentation Test Integration** - Move README code examples to integration tests for proper workflow validation
5. **Edge Case Test Consolidation** - Combine overly specific edge case tests into broader behavioral tests
6. **Assertion Pattern Improvement** - Replace string-content assertions with behavioral assertions

## Out of Scope

- Changing actual business logic or core functionality
- Removing valid behavioral tests that verify RRULE parsing and occurrence generation
- Modifying test framework configuration or PHPUnit setup
- Altering sabre/dav compatibility testing infrastructure
- Changes to existing python-dateutil fixture validation system

## Expected Deliverable

1. Reduced test suite focused on business logic validation with clear separation from infrastructure
2. Properly organized testing utilities in src/Testing structure following project conventions
3. Benchmark scripts moved to appropriate scripts/ directory for development tooling
