# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Extended RRULE Compatibility Testing
> Created: 2025-08-08
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Expand existing sabre/dav compatibility testing to cover additional RRULE functionality edge cases and boundary conditions. This enhancement will strengthen confidence in RFC 5545 compliance by validating complex RRULE combinations, advanced BYWEEKNO patterns, comprehensive BYSETPOS scenarios, and performance characteristics against the established sabre/dav library.

## User Stories

### Library Maintainer Ensuring RFC 5545 Compliance

As a library maintainer, I want to validate that Rruler handles complex RRULE edge cases identically to sabre/dav, so that I can confidently guarantee RFC 5545 compliance for users migrating from or comparing against established solutions.

This involves testing intricate combinations like BYWEEKNO with BYSETPOS, leap year boundary conditions, month-end date calculations, and timezone-aware processing to ensure no subtle differences exist between implementations.

### Developer Trusting Compatibility

As a developer integrating Rruler into my application, I want comprehensive proof that it produces identical results to sabre/dav for all supported RRULE patterns, so that I can trust the library's accuracy without extensive manual validation.

This requires extensive test coverage of edge cases including negative BYMONTHDAY values, complex BYDAY patterns with positional prefixes, BYWEEKNO across year boundaries, and BYSETPOS filtering of large occurrence sets.

## Spec Scope

1. **Complex RRULE Combinations** - Test intricate combinations of BYWEEKNO, BYSETPOS, BYDAY, BYMONTHDAY, and BYMONTH parameters
2. **BYWEEKNO Edge Cases** - Comprehensive testing of week number patterns across year boundaries and leap years
3. **BYSETPOS Scenarios** - Advanced occurrence selection with positive and negative BYSETPOS values
4. **Boundary Condition Testing** - Month-end dates, leap year handling, and timezone-aware calculations
5. **Performance Validation** - Ensure comparable performance characteristics to sabre/dav for large occurrence sets

## Out of Scope

- Implementation of new RRULE parameters not already supported by Rruler
- WebDAV or CalDAV protocol compatibility beyond RRULE parsing
- User interface or API changes to existing functionality
- Timezone database management or VTIMEZONE processing

## Expected Deliverable

1. Extended test suite with 100+ additional compatibility test cases covering complex RRULE edge cases
2. Performance benchmarking validation ensuring Rruler performance remains comparable to sabre/dav
3. Comprehensive documentation of all tested edge cases and boundary conditions for future reference
