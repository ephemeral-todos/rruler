# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-08-08-extended-rrule-compatibility/spec.md

## Technical Requirements

- Extend existing sabre/dav compatibility testing framework to cover 100+ additional edge cases
- Implement comprehensive BYWEEKNO testing across year boundaries and leap years  
- Add BYSETPOS testing with positive and negative values for large occurrence sets
- Create boundary condition tests for month-end dates and timezone-aware calculations
- Add performance benchmarking to ensure comparable performance to sabre/dav
- Generate detailed compatibility reports documenting all tested edge cases

## Test Implementation Approach

- Leverage existing EnhancedIcalCompatibilityFramework for consistent testing patterns
- Create focused test suites for each RRULE parameter combination
- Use data-driven testing with comprehensive edge case datasets
- Implement automated comparison assertions against sabre/dav results
- Add performance measurement and regression tracking
- Generate machine-readable compatibility matrices for documentation
