## Overview

Fix critical sabre/dav compatibility issues identified through comprehensive testing to improve compatibility from 97.5% to 98%+ while documenting acceptable implementation differences. This spec addresses the 4 implementation differences with a prioritized approach focusing on fixing critical bugs and properly documenting intentional design differences.

## User Stories

### Library Developer Story

As a PHP developer integrating Rruler into my calendar application, I want maximum compatibility with sabre/dav occurrence generation so that I can confidently migrate from sabre/dav or use both libraries interchangeably without worrying about behavioral differences in complex recurrence patterns.

The developer expects that complex yearly patterns with time components maintain their time portions correctly, and that any remaining differences are clearly documented with justification for the design decisions.

### Quality Assurance Story

As a QA engineer testing calendar functionality, I want clear documentation of known compatibility differences so that I can write appropriate test cases and understand which behaviors are intentional design choices versus bugs that need fixing.

This includes understanding why certain BYWEEKNO patterns might behave differently and having confidence that time portion preservation works correctly across all recurrence frequencies.

## Spec Scope

1. **Time Portion Loss Fix** - Resolve critical bug where yearly/complex patterns lose time components during occurrence generation
2. **Weekly BYSETPOS Investigation** - Analyze RFC 5545 compliance for weekly boundary logic and determine appropriate action
3. **Compatibility Documentation** - Create comprehensive COMPATIBILITY_ISSUES.md documenting acceptable differences
4. **Test Suite Updates** - Skip problematic tests we won't fix and add regression tests for fixed issues
5. **Validation Framework** - Ensure all fixes maintain existing functionality while improving compatibility

## Out of Scope

- Complete BYWEEKNO week numbering system overhaul (acceptable difference due to complexity/benefit ratio)
- DTSTART inclusion edge case fixes for specialized patterns (low impact, high complexity)
- Performance optimization of compatibility fixes (functionality over performance priority)
- Backward compatibility breaking changes to achieve 100% compatibility

## Expected Deliverable

1. Time portion preservation working correctly for all recurrence patterns tested in browser/integration tests
2. Compatibility rate improved from 97.5% to 98%+ with remaining differences properly documented
3. COMPATIBILITY_ISSUES.md file clearly explaining which differences are intentional and why
