# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-08-08-compatibility-fixes/spec.md

> Created: 2025-08-08
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

### Phase 1: Time Portion Loss Fix (HIGH Priority)

- **Root Cause Analysis:** Investigate DefaultOccurrenceGenerator and related DateTime handling code to identify where time components are being stripped from yearly/complex patterns
- **Fix Implementation:** Ensure all DateTime operations preserve time components throughout the occurrence generation pipeline
- **Regression Testing:** Add specific test cases that verify time portion preservation across all frequency types
- **Validation:** Confirm fixes against failing sabre/dav compatibility tests without breaking existing functionality

### Phase 2: Weekly BYSETPOS Investigation (MEDIUM Priority)

- **RFC 5545 Analysis:** Deep dive into RFC 5545 specification for weekly BYSETPOS boundary logic requirements
- **Behavior Comparison:** Document specific differences between Rruler and sabre/dav implementations
- **Decision Matrix:** Determine whether to fix implementation or document as acceptable difference based on RFC compliance
- **Implementation Path:** Either create additional subtask spec for fixes OR skip problematic tests with documentation

### Phase 3: Compatibility Documentation Framework

- **COMPATIBILITY_ISSUES.md Creation:** Comprehensive documentation file explaining all known differences with sabre/dav
- **Test Suite Updates:** Skip tests for documented acceptable differences with clear reasoning
- **Documentation Categories:** Organize differences by impact level (Critical, Medium, Low) and fix status
- **Maintenance Guidelines:** Establish process for evaluating future compatibility differences

## Approach

### Three-Phase Implementation Strategy

1. **Immediate Fix:** Address time portion loss as it's a clear bug affecting core functionality
2. **Investigate & Decide:** Analyze weekly BYSETPOS logic against RFC 5545 to determine appropriate action
3. **Document & Update:** Create comprehensive documentation and update test suite accordingly

### Code Quality Standards

- **No Backward Compatibility Breaks:** All fixes must maintain existing API and behavior for currently working functionality
- **Test-Driven Approach:** Write failing tests for bugs before implementing fixes
- **RFC 5545 Compliance:** Ensure all changes align with RFC 5545 specifications
- **Performance Neutrality:** Fixes should not introduce performance regressions

## External Dependencies

No new external dependencies required. All fixes will use existing PHP DateTime classes and internal architecture.
