# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Enhanced iCalendar Compatibility Testing
> Created: 2025-08-08
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Add comprehensive testing against sabre/vobject for iCalendar parsing to ensure robust compatibility with real-world iCalendar files beyond current coverage. This specification extends our existing RFC 5545 parsing capabilities by validating against complex multi-component files and edge cases found in production calendar systems.

## User Stories

### Developer Using Complex iCalendar Files

As a PHP developer building a calendar application, I want to parse complex iCalendar files containing multiple VEVENT and VTODO components with various edge cases, so that my application can handle real-world calendar data from different sources without parsing failures.

**Detailed Workflow:** Developer receives an exported .ics file from Microsoft Outlook, Google Calendar, or Apple Calendar containing dozens of events with different date formats, recurring patterns, and component structures. They need to extract DTSTART and DUE properties reliably and generate occurrence dates that match the original calendar system's behavior.

### Library Maintainer Ensuring Parsing Accuracy

As a library maintainer, I want comprehensive validation of iCalendar parsing against the industry-standard sabre/vobject library, so that I can confidently guarantee parsing accuracy and compatibility with established calendar ecosystems.

**Detailed Workflow:** Maintainer creates test scenarios using real-world iCalendar files, validates parsing results against sabre/vobject output, and ensures that any differences are documented and justified. This provides confidence when releasing updates and helps identify regressions in parsing behavior.

## Spec Scope

1. **Complex VCALENDAR File Testing** - Validate parsing of multi-component iCalendar files with 10+ VEVENT/VTODO components
2. **VEVENT/VTODO Edge Case Parsing** - Handle malformed or unusual component structures that exist in real-world files
3. **Extended DATE/DATE-TIME Format Variations** - Support additional date format variations found in different calendar applications
4. **DTSTART/DUE Property Edge Cases** - Extract date/time properties from components with unusual formatting or missing values
5. **Real-World File Parsing Scenarios** - Test against exported files from major calendar applications (Outlook, Google, Apple)

## Out of Scope

- Full iCalendar specification support beyond VEVENT/VTODO components (VJOURNAL, VFREEBUSY, etc.)
- Timezone database implementation or complex timezone handling
- CalDAV protocol support or server-side calendar functionality
- Performance optimization for extremely large calendar files (100+ components)

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Extended Compatibility Test Suite** - Comprehensive test coverage comparing parsing results with sabre/vobject
2. **Real-World File Validation** - Test scenarios using actual exported iCalendar files from major calendar applications
3. **Edge Case Documentation** - Detailed documentation of parsing edge cases and how they're handled compared to sabre/vobject
