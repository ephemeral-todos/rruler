# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-08-08-enhanced-ical-compatibility/spec.md

> Created: 2025-08-08
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

### Enhanced Test Infrastructure
- **Extended Test Dataset**: Create comprehensive test files with 10+ VEVENT/VTODO components each
- **Real-World File Integration**: Source actual exported iCalendar files from Microsoft Outlook, Google Calendar, and Apple Calendar
- **sabre/vobject Compatibility Testing**: Implement side-by-side parsing comparison with sabre/vobject library
- **Edge Case Documentation**: Automatic generation of parsing difference reports between Rruler and sabre/vobject

### iCalendar Parsing Enhancements
- **Multi-Component File Handling**: Robust parsing of VCALENDAR files containing mixed VEVENT and VTODO components
- **DATE/DATE-TIME Format Variations**: Extended support for date format variations found in different calendar applications
- **Malformed Component Recovery**: Graceful handling of malformed or unusual component structures while maintaining compatibility
- **Property Extraction Reliability**: Enhanced DTSTART/DUE property extraction with fallback mechanisms for missing or invalid values

### Validation Framework
- **Automated Compatibility Verification**: Test suite that automatically compares Rruler parsing results with sabre/vobject
- **Performance Benchmarking**: Measure parsing performance against sabre/vobject for files with varying component counts
- **Error Handling Validation**: Ensure consistent error handling between Rruler and sabre/vobject for invalid inputs
- **Regression Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage to prevent parsing regressions in future releases

## Approach

### Implementation Strategy
1. **Test Data Collection**: Gather real-world iCalendar files from major calendar applications through export functionality
2. **Comparative Testing Framework**: Build automated testing infrastructure to compare parsing results between Rruler and sabre/vobject
3. **Edge Case Analysis**: Identify and document parsing differences, implementing compatibility adjustments where appropriate
4. **Performance Validation**: Ensure parsing performance remains competitive while maintaining compatibility

### Testing Architecture
- **File-Based Test Suite**: Organize test files by source application and complexity level
- **Assertion Framework**: Implement detailed comparison assertions for component extraction and property parsing
- **Compatibility Matrix**: Document supported features and known differences with sabre/vobject
- **Automated Reporting**: Generate compatibility reports showing parsing accuracy and performance metrics

## External Dependencies

- **sabre/vobject** (dev-only) - Industry standard RFC 5545 library for compatibility validation
  - **Justification:** Required for comparative testing and validation against established parsing behavior
  - **Usage:** Development and testing only, not a production dependency
- **Real-World Test Data** - Exported iCalendar files from major calendar applications
  - **Sources:** Microsoft Outlook .ics exports, Google Calendar exports, Apple Calendar exports
  - **Purpose:** Validate parsing behavior against actual production calendar data
