# Enhanced iCalendar Compatibility Testing - Lite Summary

Add comprehensive testing against sabre/vobject for iCalendar parsing to ensure robust compatibility with real-world iCalendar files beyond current coverage. This specification extends our existing RFC 5545 parsing capabilities by validating against complex multi-component files and edge cases found in production calendar systems from major applications like Microsoft Outlook, Google Calendar, and Apple Calendar.

## Key Points
- Validate parsing of complex VCALENDAR files with 10+ VEVENT/VTODO components against sabre/vobject
- Handle real-world edge cases including malformed components and unusual date format variations
- Test against actual exported files from major calendar applications to ensure production compatibility
