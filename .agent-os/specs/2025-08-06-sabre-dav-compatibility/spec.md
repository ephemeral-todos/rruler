> Spec: sabre/dav Compatibility Testing
> Created: 2025-08-06
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement comprehensive compatibility testing against the sabre/dav library to validate RFC 5545 compliance and ensure interoperability with the industry-standard WebDAV/CalDAV implementation. This testing framework will provide confidence that Rruler produces identical RRULE parsing and occurrence generation results as sabre/dav for all supported parameters.

## User Stories

### Compatibility Validation

As a **PHP Developer** integrating Rruler into my application, I want to verify that RRULE parsing produces the same results as sabre/dav, so that I can confidently migrate from or interoperate with existing sabre/dav-based systems.

**Workflow:** Developer runs compatibility test suite which compares RRULE parsing and occurrence generation between Rruler and sabre/dav across hundreds of test patterns, receiving a detailed report of any discrepancies and confirmation of full compatibility.

### RFC 5545 Compliance Verification

As a **Calendar System Architect** building enterprise scheduling systems, I want proof that Rruler follows RFC 5545 specifications correctly, so that I can ensure reliable interoperability with other calendar systems.

**Workflow:** Architect reviews compatibility test results showing side-by-side comparison of complex RRULE patterns between Rruler and the established sabre/dav implementation, confirming identical behavior for all supported features.

## Spec Scope

1. **Compatibility Test Framework** - Create infrastructure for side-by-side testing against sabre/dav
2. **RRULE Parsing Comparison** - Validate identical parsing behavior for all supported RRULE parameters
3. **Occurrence Generation Testing** - Compare occurrence calculation results across date ranges and patterns
4. **Comprehensive Pattern Coverage** - Test all combinations of FREQ, INTERVAL, COUNT, UNTIL, BYDAY, BYMONTHDAY, BYMONTH, BYWEEKNO, BYSETPOS
5. **Performance Benchmarking** - Compare execution speed and memory usage against sabre/dav

## Out of Scope

- Testing unsupported RRULE parameters (BYYEARDAY, BYEASTER, etc.)
- WebDAV/CalDAV protocol compatibility beyond RRULE
- Migration tools from sabre/dav to Rruler
- Compatibility with other calendar libraries besides sabre/dav

## Expected Deliverable

1. Compatibility test suite that runs automated comparisons between Rruler and sabre/dav
2. Comprehensive test report showing 100% compatibility for supported RRULE features
3. Performance benchmarks comparing execution characteristics between libraries
4. Documentation proving RFC 5545 compliance through sabre/dav validation
