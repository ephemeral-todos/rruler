# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-08-06-sabre-dav-compatibility/spec.md

> Created: 2025-08-06
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

### Compatibility Test Framework
- **Test Runner Infrastructure** - PHPUnit-based test suite for automated sabre/dav comparison
- **Test Data Generation** - Comprehensive RRULE pattern generation covering all parameter combinations
- **Result Comparison Logic** - Side-by-side parsing and occurrence generation comparison
- **Reporting System** - Detailed compatibility reports with pass/fail status and discrepancy analysis

### RRULE Pattern Coverage
- **Basic Patterns** - All FREQ values (DAILY, WEEKLY, MONTHLY, YEARLY) with INTERVAL variations
- **Termination Patterns** - COUNT and UNTIL parameter combinations across different date ranges  
- **Advanced Patterns** - BYDAY with positional prefixes, BYMONTHDAY with negative values, BYMONTH selections
- **Complex Patterns** - BYWEEKNO for yearly patterns, BYSETPOS for occurrence selection
- **Edge Cases** - Leap years, month boundaries, timezone handling, invalid date scenarios

### Performance Testing
- **Execution Speed Comparison** - Measure parsing and occurrence generation performance
- **Memory Usage Analysis** - Compare memory footprint between libraries
- **Scalability Testing** - Test with large date ranges and high occurrence counts
- **Benchmark Reporting** - Performance comparison reports with statistical analysis

### Integration Requirements
- **sabre/dav Dependency** - Add sabre/vobject as development dependency for comparison testing
- **Test Environment Setup** - Automated test environment configuration for both libraries
- **CI/CD Integration** - Include compatibility tests in GitHub Actions workflow
- **Version Compatibility** - Support multiple sabre/dav versions for compatibility validation

## Approach

### Test Framework Architecture
1. **Abstract Test Base** - Common test infrastructure for pattern generation and result comparison
2. **Comparison Engine** - Core logic for running identical RRULE patterns through both libraries
3. **Pattern Generators** - Systematic generation of RRULE test cases covering all parameter combinations
4. **Result Validators** - Assertion logic for comparing parsing results and occurrence arrays

### Testing Methodology
1. **Systematic Pattern Coverage** - Generate test patterns for every supported RRULE parameter combination
2. **Identical Input Processing** - Feed exact same RRULE strings and DTSTART values to both libraries
3. **Result Normalization** - Convert both libraries' outputs to comparable formats (DateTime arrays)
4. **Comprehensive Assertion** - Validate identical parsing behavior, occurrence counts, and date sequences

### Performance Benchmarking
1. **Micro-benchmarks** - Isolated performance testing of parsing and occurrence generation
2. **Real-world Scenarios** - Performance testing with typical calendar application usage patterns
3. **Memory Profiling** - Track memory allocation patterns and peak usage for both libraries
4. **Statistical Analysis** - Multiple test runs with statistical significance testing

## External Dependencies

### sabre/vobject
- **Purpose** - Industry-standard WebDAV/CalDAV library for compatibility validation
- **Justification** - Provides the reference implementation for RFC 5545 compliance testing
- **Scope** - Development dependency only, not included in production library
- **Version** - Latest stable version compatible with PHP 8.3+

### Benchmark Utilities
- **Purpose** - Precise performance measurement and statistical analysis tools
- **Justification** - Required for accurate performance comparison and reporting
- **Scope** - Development dependency for performance testing suite
- **Components** - PHPBench or similar micro-benchmarking framework
