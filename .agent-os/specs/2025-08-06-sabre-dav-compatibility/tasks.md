  - [ ] 2.2 Implement BasicFrequencyCompatibilityTest covering FREQ and INTERVAL combinations
  - [ ] 2.3 Create test cases for COUNT and UNTIL termination conditions
  - [ ] 2.4 Add date range testing across different years and leap year scenarios
  - [ ] 2.5 Verify all basic pattern tests pass with 100% compatibility

- [ ] 3. Implement Advanced RRULE Parameter Compatibility Tests
  - [ ] 3.1 Write tests for BYDAY parameter compatibility including positional prefixes
  - [ ] 3.2 Create BYMONTHDAY compatibility tests with positive and negative values
  - [ ] 3.3 Implement BYMONTH compatibility testing for yearly patterns
  - [ ] 3.4 Add BYWEEKNO compatibility tests for week-based yearly patterns
  - [ ] 3.5 Create BYSETPOS compatibility tests for occurrence selection
  - [ ] 3.6 Verify all advanced parameter tests pass with identical results

- [ ] 4. Implement Complex Pattern and Edge Case Testing
  - [ ] 4.1 Write tests for complex multi-parameter RRULE combinations
  - [ ] 4.2 Create edge case tests for leap years, month boundaries, and invalid dates
  - [ ] 4.3 Implement timezone handling compatibility tests
  - [ ] 4.4 Add boundary condition tests for very large date ranges and occurrence counts
  - [ ] 4.5 Create error handling compatibility tests for malformed RRULE strings
  - [ ] 4.6 Verify all complex pattern and edge case tests pass

- [ ] 5. Implement Performance Benchmarking Suite
  - [ ] 5.1 Write tests for performance comparison infrastructure
  - [ ] 5.2 Add PHPBench or similar micro-benchmarking framework as dev dependency
  - [ ] 5.3 Create parsing performance benchmarks comparing both libraries
  - [ ] 5.4 Implement occurrence generation performance tests across different patterns
  - [ ] 5.5 Add memory usage profiling and comparison utilities
  - [ ] 5.6 Create performance report generation with statistical analysis
  - [ ] 5.7 Verify all performance benchmarks execute successfully

- [ ] 6. Integration and Reporting
  - [ ] 6.1 Write tests for compatibility report generation
  - [ ] 6.2 Integrate compatibility tests into existing PHPUnit test suite
  - [ ] 6.3 Add compatibility testing to GitHub Actions CI workflow
